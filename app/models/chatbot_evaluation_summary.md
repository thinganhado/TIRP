# Chatbot Evaluation Summary

## Overview
The rule-based chatbot with machine learning enhancements has been evaluated using a comprehensive suite of tests across five domains: academic, wellbeing, bullying, social interactions, and friendship. The chatbot was tested on its ability to correctly interpret natural language queries and make appropriate changes to configuration parameters for each domain.

## Test Results
- **Overall Accuracy**: 28.0%
- **Academic Domain**: 20.0% (1/5 tests passed)
- **Wellbeing Domain**: 20.0% (1/5 tests passed)
- **Bullying Domain**: 20.0% (1/5 tests passed)
- **Social Domain**: 20.0% (1/5 tests passed)
- **Friendship Domain**: 60.0% (3/5 tests passed)

The friendship domain shows the best performance, while all other domains need significant improvement.

## Key Findings
1. The chatbot correctly identifies the domain from natural language input in most cases
2. Parameter changes are correctly made for the first query in each domain session
3. Subsequent queries in the same domain do not make additional parameter changes
4. Some query phrasing patterns are recognized better than others
5. The trained machine learning model provides limited improvement over the rule-based system

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Enhance Domain Detection**: Improve the matching logic to better identify intents and domains from a wider variety of query phrasings.

2. **Parameter Change History**: Implement a history tracking system to avoid setting the same parameters multiple times, instead making incremental changes based on previous values.

3. **Intent Classification**: Train the intent classification model on a larger dataset with more diverse phrasings for each domain.

4. **Response Customization**: Generate more specific responses that reflect the actual parameter changes made, rather than generic domain responses.

5. **Test Case Coverage**: Expand the test cases to cover a wider range of query types and edge cases.

6. **Continuous Learning**: Implement a feedback mechanism to learn from user interactions and improve accuracy over time.

## Conclusion
While the chatbot demonstrates basic functionality for interpreting natural language requests and modifying configuration parameters, its current accuracy of 28% falls well below the recommended 80% threshold for production deployment. With the improvements outlined above, particularly focusing on the domain recognition and parameter adjustment logic, the chatbot's performance could be significantly enhanced.

The friendship domain's superior performance provides a model for improving the other domains by adopting similar pattern recognition and parameter adjustment strategies.
